For my final draft, I finally figured out how to do everything. To be honest, figuring out GIMP was a bit tougher than I originally anticipated. I thought it would be easy, but I found that really wasn't the case. In terms of the images, I used the tool that allowed me to create a path and then only selecting that layer yielded me the ability to color one specific image. I was able to only color the lottery ticket red instead of making the whole image slightly red. This feature is called HSL Color. This provided the bright red I was desiring. Then, I was able to color the background a navy which was obtained by using the Darken Only feature. After doing that, I wanted to blue the words on the lottery ticket. Using the blur/sharpen tool allowed me to fade the words on the lottery ticket dramatically. Then I picked an interview with the author which allowed me to pick the best quotes. 

I overlayed the text in an American Flag way. With the words being stripes and being overlayed on top of the red ticket. But the red ticket has the most important words where he discusses that America has and always will be his dream. I added the stars to symbolize the stars of the American flag as well.
